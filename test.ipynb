The F-22 will remain a cornerstone of the USAF\\'s fighter fleet until its succession by the crewed Next Generation Air Dominance fighter. == Development ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\n\\nThe F-22 originated from the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program that the U.S. Air Force initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. Although the F-15 and F-16 had only recently entered service, intelligence reports indicated that their effectiveness would be quickly eroded by emerging worldwide threats emanating from the Soviet Union, including new developments in surface-to-air missile systems for integrated air defense networks, the introduction of the Beriev A-50 \"Mainstay\" airborne warning and control system (AWACS), and the proliferation of the Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\"- and Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\"-class of fighter aircraft. Initially code-named \"Senior Sky\", the ATF would become an air superiority fighter program influenced by these reports; in the potential scenario of a Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion in Central Europe, the ATF was envisaged to spearhead offensive and defensive counter-air operations (OCA/DCA) in this highly contested environment that would then enable following echelons of NATO strike and attack aircraft to hit ground formations; to do so, the ATF would make an ambitious leap in capability and survivability by taking advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon, including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight control systems and avionics, more powerful propulsion systems for supersonic cruise (or supercruise) over Mach 1.5, and most importantly, stealth technology for low observability. The USAF initiated an ATF request for information (RFI) to the aerospace industry in May 1981 as well as a subsequent concept development team (CDT) for identifying requirements and managing concept and technology development.', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor', 'summary': \"The Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor is an American twin-engine all-weather stealth fighter aircraft developed and produced for the United States Air Force (USAF).

As a product of the USAF\\'s Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program the aircraft was designed as an air superiority fighter, but also incorporates ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22\\'s airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while program partner Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems. The F-22 descended from the Lockheed YF-22 and first flew in 1997, and was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A. Although the USAF had originally planned to buy a total of 750 ATFs, it later scaled down to 381, and the program was ultimately cut to 195 aircraft — 187 of them operational models — in 2009 due to political opposition from high costs, a lack of air-to-air missions at the time of production, and the development of the more affordable and versatile F-35. The last aircraft was delivered in 2012. After a protracted development and initial operational difficulties, the F-22 became a critical component of the USAF\\'s tactical airpower for air-to-air missions against peer adversaries. While designed for counter-air operations, the aircraft has also performed strike and electronic support missions in the Middle East against the Islamic State and Assad-aligned forces. The F-22 will remain a cornerstone of the USAF\\'s fighter fleet until its succession by the crewed Next Generation Air Dominance fighter. == Development ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\n\\nThe F-22 originated from the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program that the U.S. Air Force initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. Although the F-15 and F-16 had only recently entered service, intelligence reports indicated that their effectiveness would be quickly eroded by emerging worldwide threats emanating from the Soviet Union, including new developments in surface-to-air missile systems for integrated air defense networks, the introduction of the Beriev A-50 \"Mainstay\" airborne warning and control system (AWACS), and the proliferation of the Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\"- and Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\"-class of fighter aircraft. Initially code-named \"Senior Sky\", the ATF would become an air superiority fighter program influenced by these reports; in the potential scenario of a Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion in Central Europe, the ATF was envisaged to spearhead offensive and defensive counter-air operations (OCA/DCA) in this highly contested environment that would then enable following echelons of NATO strike and attack aircraft to hit ground formations; to do so, the ATF would make an ambitious leap in capability and survivability by taking advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon, including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight control systems and avionics, more powerful propulsion systems for supersonic cruise (or supercruise) over Mach 1.5, and most importantly, stealth technology for low observability. The USAF initiated an ATF request for information (RFI) to the aerospace industry in May 1981 as well as a subsequent concept development team (CDT) for identifying requirements and managing concept and technology development.', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor', 'summary': \"The Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor is an American twin-engine all-weather stealth fighter aircraft developed and produced for the United States Air Force (USAF).
